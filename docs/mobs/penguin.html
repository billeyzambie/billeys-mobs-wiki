        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Ice Cream</h3>
<p>If you put a pet chef hat(crafted with kiwi feathers and wool) on a penguin and give it sugar, it will make you an ice cream, ice cream gives you a few beneficial effects, and is even more powerful in warm biomes and in the nether.</p>
<p>However in cold biomes it gives you detrimental effects instead.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Penguin Boots</h3>
<p>Penguins also randomly shed feathers with which Players can craft penguin boots which give you lots of speed on snow and ice, especially on ice, and even more on packed and blue ice, as well as a little bit of speed on sand.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
