<h3>Chocolate Catfish</h3>
<p>When they die they drop a raw catfish which can be eaten either cooked or raw to get string or used with cocoa beans in a crafting table and then cooked to get a chocolate catfish which gives a lot of speed for quite some time.</p>
<p>Chocolate catfish can also be used to boost terraphins and cucumbeels while riding them for an entire minute.</p>

<h3>Catfish Antibodies</h3>
<p>Players can get temporary immunity to a particular effect by injecting yourself with catfish antibodies while you have the effects you want to get immunity from.</p>
<p>The immunity lasts for 10 minutes, and also getting a new immunity clears previous immunities.Catfish antibodies can also be injected in mobs, tamed or not, to do the same thing. Catfish antibodies can also make you immune to beneficial effects so beware of that unless you&#x27;re injecting a hostile mob that gives itself beneficial effects. Additionally the injections deals 1 HP or half a heart of damage but cannot be used to kill things other than killing yourself.</p>

<section class='ability-section'>
