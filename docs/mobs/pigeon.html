<h3>Pooping</h3>
<p>They poop randomly, and their poop can either be used to craft bone meal, used to boost pollinating mobs of this add-on(pill bugs and stick bugs), or used with a boring powder in a crafting table to craft a potion of slow falling.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>

<h3>Finding apples</h3>
<p>They Tamed pigeons will also find apples in trees, if you haven&#x27;t made them sit.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Sending items to players</h3>
<p>Pigeons can also be used to send items to other players.</p>
<p>To start craft a pigeon backpack(2 string, 1 kiwi feathers and 2 leather) and put it on a pigeon. Pet(sneak + long tap or right click or pet button) the pigeon while holding item to put it in it, pet it while you&#x27;re holding an item and the pigeon is generally full to make the pigeon drop its items and pet it with an empty hand to select the player to send the pigeon to(the players must be in the same dimension as you and not right next to you). The pigeon backpack can also be dyed by using a dye on the pigeon that&#x27;s wearing it. Pigeons refuse shulker boxes, backpack items, and locked items. If the backpack is full, it drops all stored items on the ground instead of adding the new one. The mission picker only lists players at least 32 blocks away.</p>
