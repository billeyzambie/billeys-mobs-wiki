        <h2>Taming</h2>
        <p>They are tamed using raw or cooked, fish, chicken, or hamster, or with leaves.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Throwing Pets</h3>
<p>When a tamed giraffe cat has a target and there&#x27;s a nearby tamed pet of the same owner, it will usually pick up and yeet the other pet at the enemy.</p>
<p>If the thrown pet hits the target it will deal damage on impact and will continue to attack the target, even if it doesn&#x27;t usually defend its owner. Pets that are sitting will not be yeeted. The giraffe cat searches within 2.5 blocks for a following, non-sitting pet owned by the same player. Thrown pets are yeeted over about 1 second (20 ticks) and are given a bravery tag so they keep fighting.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Living Ladder</h3>
<p>If you use a ladder on a giraffe cat, it will usually extend its neck and allow you to use it as a ladder.</p>
<p>Players can increase or decrease its ladder height up to 64 blocks by using a ladder on it while not sneaking or sneaking respectively. After climbing above your giraffe cat, it teleports to you and returns to normal, even if it was sitting. If you do not want that to happen then either let your friends climb it first or make it wander. The ladder height caps at 64 blocks and only grows if the block above is clear. The cat only starts the ladder if there is a solid, slab, or leaf block in front of it and no solid block above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Digging Up Mobs</h3>
<p>If the giraffe cat is generally standing on grass or dirt, and fed a giraffe cat treat, it will usually shove its head in the ground and eventually dig up a random borrowing critter like a rat, hamster, or kiwi.</p>
<p>Other add-ons can add more mobs to the diggable mobs, see line 428 in scripts/billeys_mobs/giraffe_cat.js in the add-on&#x27;s behavior pack if you&#x27;re an add-on creator. Digging only succeeds if the giraffe cat is standing on dirt or grass and is at full health. The default burrowing table is 2/6 rats (33%), 3/6 hamsters (50%), and 1/6 kiwis (17%).</p>

      <section id='breeding'>
        <h2>Breeding</h2>
        <h3>Crossbreeding with Cats</h3>
<p>If you breed a giraffe cat with a cat, the result will usually be a giraffe cat with the texture of the cat.</p>
      </section>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Giraffe cats can level up by killing mobs, either directly or by throwing pets.</p>
<p>When they level up their health and attack damage increase.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
