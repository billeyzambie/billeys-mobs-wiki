<h3>Mergoose Spikes</h3>
<p>When they attack something they drop mergoose spikes, which can be used on stick bugs to make them deal twice as much attack damage temporalily.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Mergoose Sword</h3>
<p>Mergoose spikes can also be used to craft a mergoose sword(diamond sword + 8 mergoose spikes), which is generally like a normal iron sword but it can deal damage from quite a long distance if you press the button you press to throw items(eg.</p>
<p>long tap on mobile, right click on pc). And also Once tamed mergeese defend their owner.</p>
