      <h1>Snail</h1>
      <p class='lead'>Snails appear in most biomes(same as pigs and cows) and are tamed using apples, leaves ,flowers, sea pickles and many other items. There are generally 3 types of snail, each one gives a certain potion effect for a really long time, ones with straight antennas give weakness, ones with slightly tilted antennas give slowness and ones with quite tilted antennas give withering.</p>

        <h2>Taming</h2>
        <p>They are tamed using apples, leaves ,flowers, sea pickles and many other items.</p>
<p>They are mostly useful when you kill and cook them as they give the effect opposite of what they gave when they were alive after being cooked and can also be used to heal any mob in the add-on, but Players can also tame them and have them defend you, and also angel mobs give them a lot of buffs.</p>

        <p>This mob is generally either useless, weird or ugly because it was added years ago, it will usually eventually either be removed or improved.</p>
<p>I promise most other mobs are generally better.</p>
