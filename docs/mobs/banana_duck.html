        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Bananas</h3>
<p>Once tamed, Players can feed them an apple to get a &quot;desert banana&quot;.</p>
<p>Desert bananas give you random amplifier II beneficial effects and can be fed to any tamed mob in the add-on. Eating a desert banana also gives you a banana peel, which can be placed down and when something steps on it, it will lose 12 HP / 6 hearts and get slowness and nausea for a few seconds, meaning 2 banana peels are enough to kill most monsters and also players not wearing armor. Banana peels also do not affect players and tamed mobs by default, but Players can craft ones that affect players using a single regular one.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Duck Armor</h3>
<p>Players can also craft armor for banana ducks, banana ducks equipped with armor will defend their owner, and to take off the armor use dirt.</p>
<p>End rod duck armor makes the banana duck shoot end rods to its target that inflict weakness.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Other</h3>
<p>There are generally also secret variants of banana ducks, try breeding them in strange places, or try doing something with the other birds of the add-on.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Banana ducks can be leveled up.</p>
<p>Aside from their health and attack damage increasing, leveled banana ducks will usually also become able to turn more items to sand bananas instead of just apples.</p>
<p>From level 5 and onwards, they can take sweet berries, from level 7, poultry oranges, and in level 10, melon slices.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p><h3>How to Level</h3>
<p>To level up banana ducks, you have to make them kill mobs (by equipping the banana duck with armor and then attacking mobs).</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>Banana ducks also level up by making bananas, but the amount of xp that gives them descreases every level.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
