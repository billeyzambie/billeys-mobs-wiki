        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Robbing Mobs</h3>
<p>After taming them, you&#x27;ll be able to make them attack and rob villagers, wandering traders and piglins making them drop emerald and gold, or some of their trades.</p>
<p>However, unlike overworld rats, netherrats can defend their owner from any kind of mob whether they can rob it or not, but they&#x27;re still quite weak.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>If you equip a netherrat with a pet chef hat(crafted with kiwi feathers and wool) and give it a bowl, you&#x27;ll get a bowl of spicy ratatouille, which gives regeneration, resistance and fire resistance when eaten but makes you loose a bit of health.</p>
<p>If you give it a glass bottle instead, you&#x27;ll get a bottle of warped wine, which gives haste when drank but also has a chance to give nausea and/or weakness.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Putting them on your head</h3>
<p>Players can also put them on your head by petting them(sneak + right click/long tap) and then walking into them.</p>
<p>Netherrats will usually get off your head either when you jump while sneaking or when you hit a mob netherrats can rob. Also, while netherrats are generally on top of your head, they are immune to any kind of damage.</p>
