      <h1>Hammerhead Shark</h1>
      <p class='lead'>Hammerhead sharks appear in oceans, can be scooped into a bucket and tamed using sea pizza, but they do not follow you unless you use a stick on them. When they attack something, they will drop a few shark teeth, which can be used to craft either the shark tooth sword, which deals a lot of damage for its price, has low durability and has a sweeping edge effect, or used to upgrade a fish sword to a golden fish sword which has more durability, deals more damage and cooks small fish.</p>

<p>I promise most other mobs are generally better.</p>
