        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Finding Items</h3>
<p>Once tamed, if they&#x27;re not sitting, they will find random items in grass and water, mostly seeds, fishing loot and rarely ore nuggets(including diamond nuggets).</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Duck Armor</h3>
<p>Players can also craft armor for them, ducks equipped with armor will defend their owner, and to take off the armor use dirt.</p>
<p>End rod duck armor makes the duck shoot end rods to its target that inflict weakness.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Rubber Ducky Pet Hat</h3>
<p>The Rubber Ducky pet hat is generally an item rarely found by ducks in water.</p>
<p>It can be equipped on any pet from this add-on and make it more likely to &quot;combo&quot;(hit its target without getting hurt back) its target. It also enables pets that do not usually fight for you, to fight for you anyway, just like any piece of pet equipment that makes the pet stronger does(currently just this and the rat crown).</p>
</section>

      </section>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Ducks can be leveled up.</p>
<p>To level up ducks, you have to make them kill mobs (by equipping the duck with armor and then attacking mobs).</p>
<p>When a duck levels up, its health, attack damage, speed and reach increase.</p>
<p>Leveled ducks will usually also find items in grass and water more often, and from level 5 and onwards the items they find will also start becoming better.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
