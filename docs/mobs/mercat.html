      <h1>Mercat</h1>
      <p class='lead'>Mercats appear in lakes and rivers that aren&#x27;t frozen, and are tamed using raw piranha or sea pizza. They cannot breathe underwater and will have to come up to breathe air, can survive indefinitely without water, and can only be made to sit while on land, though like every mob in the add-on Players can use a stick to make them walk/swim around instead of following you.</p>

<h3>Changing the weather</h3>
<p>If you use a nautilus shell on a tamed mercat it will change the weather.</p>
<p>it will turn clear weather to a thunderstorm, and thunderstroms or rain to clear weather. If in multiplayer, for this to work you need at least half of all online players to be next to a mercat that is currently changing the weather. This can be achieved by either making the players each use a nautilus shell on their mercat, or by having the players around one&#x27;s mercat. The ritual only works in the Overworld and requires at least half of online players within 10 blocks of ritual mercats. If the ritual check fails, the nautilus shell is dropped back at the mercat.</p>

<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Sleeping loot</h3>
<p>Players can sleep with a mercat by having one near you not sitting before you sleep.</p>
<p>When you wake up, the mercat will usually bring you a random sea related item. Sleeping loot checks for a following, non-sitting mercat within 15 blocks of the bed. A 20-sleep streak grants the Mercat Napper advancement.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>By the way, fermented mercat milk will usually probably be used to craft mercat cheese in the future.</p>
