        <h2>Taming</h2>
        <p>Babies are tamed using raw chicken or raw hamster but adults cannot be tamed normally, only with the power banana which can tame any mob in the add-on.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Attack Effects</h3>
<p>They also get some regeneration whenever they kill something and roar at their target, inflicting withering, though their roar doesn&#x27;t affect tamed mobs from this add-on, other yutyrannuses, and players that have tamed a yutyrannus.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Taming</h3>
<p>Taming one is generally quite tricky since whenever you come too close to a baby, the entire pack will usually attack you.</p>
<p>However if you do manage to tame one it will usually defend you, attack monsters unprovoked, losing little to no health in the process, and when it grows up, if you put a saddle on it you&#x27;ll be able to ride it and control it, and you&#x27;ll also be to ride it on the surface of water.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Yutyrannus Feathers</h3>
<p>When a yutyrannus gets hurt it has a chance to drop a yutyrannus feather, which can be used to craft tipping arrows of decay.</p>
<p>Players can also shear them to get those feathers but it has a 10 minute cooldown.</p>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Yutyrannuses can level up by killing mobs, when they level their health and attack damage increase.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>However, yutyrannus roaring doesn&#x27;t give it XP, meaning in higher levels where the yutyrannus will usually kill most mobs by roaring, you&#x27;ll have to give it stronger mobs to kill, such as endermen, ravagers and iron golems.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
