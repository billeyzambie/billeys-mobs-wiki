<h3>Potato Sticks</h3>
<p>Once tamed, they will randomly turn full grown potato crops to a block that drops several potato sticks.</p>
<p>Those potato sticks combined give more nutrition and saturation that a single baked potato and can be eaten instantly. Stick bugs can be boosted with pigeon poop.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Attacking mobs without being hurt</h3>
<p>Stick bugs also defend their owner and are immune to projectiles, though they have very low health and attack damage but they become invisible before attacking, and mobs will not fight them back.</p>
<p>Stick bugs can be made to temporalily deal twice as much attack damage for an hour with mergoose spikes. You&#x27;ll know the mergoose spike boost is generally over when you are generally able to put mergoose spikes on them again. Stick bugs also dance to music discs.</p>
