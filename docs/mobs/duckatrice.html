        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Obtaining</h3>
<p>To get a duckatrice you&#x27;ll have to summon and defeat the Duckatrice Boss to get an item called Duckatrice Amber.</p>
<p>Using duckatrice amber on a level 10 duck of yours will transform it into your own pet duckatrice. Keep in mind however that the duckatrice is not an objective upgrade as duckatrices do not find items in grass and water like ducks do. After the transformation all data of the duck will be passed on to the duckatrice including owner, nametag, equipment, equipment color, etc. This means that your duckatrice will be the same variant as the that transformed to it. The transformation copies the duck’s name, variant, dynamic properties, happiness values, and equipped pet gear. If the duck’s owner is offline, the transformation fails and drops duckatrice amber.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Riding</h3>
<p>To ride your duckatrice, put a saddle on it and then right click it, long tap it or press the &quot;Ride&quot; button.</p>
<p>The saddle can be removed by attempting to put another saddle on the duckatrice while it&#x27;s already wearing one. To start flying while on the duckatrice, jump, or fall off some height. Look up to go up, look straight to go straight, or look down to go down. Duckatrices have limited stamina for going upwards unless you boost them with sweet items.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Boosting</h3>
<p>While riding a duckatrice, Players can boost its speed by feeding it sweet items from this add-on(desert bananas, poultry oranges, penguin ice cream, etc.) or rat beer or warped wine.</p>
<p>Length and strength of the speed boost varies by item. Also, duckatrices of higher level get an even stronger speed boost. While boosted, duckatrices can also go up freely. Boost items grant speed for 2 × duration seconds with amplifier (speed + 2) × 3 + 3 × duckatrice level. Sweetness values: chocolate catfish (5, 10s), ice cream (4, 4s), poultry orange (3, 2s), desert banana (2, 2s), warped wine (1, 7.55s), rat beer (1, 7.5s). Warped wine and rat beer return a glass bottle after the boost.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Duckatrice&#x27;s Stare Effect</h3>
<p>If you pet(sneak + right click/long tap/etc.) your duckatrice empty handed, you will usually lose 1 level and your helmet will be temporalily granted the Duckatrice&#x27;s Stare effect which damages mobs that are generally angry at you if you look at them.</p>
<p>Higher level duckatrices give higher levels of the stare effect.</p>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Duckatrices can level up by killing mobs, when they level up their health and attack damage increase, and some of their other abilities become better as said above.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>Duckatrices after their transformation from a duck are generally in level 1 and can be leveled up to level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
