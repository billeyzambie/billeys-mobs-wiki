      <h1>Duckatrice Boss</h1>
      <p class='lead'>The Duckatrice Boss is generally a big, flying, scary-looking duck that you have to kill to get &quot;Duckatrice Amber&quot;, which allows you to turn a level 10 duck of yours into your own pet duckatrice(which can fly and is rideable).</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>To summon a duckatrice, get a duck to sit next to some frogspawn(frog eggs) and feed the duck an ominous potion(the potion dropped by illager captains).</p>
<p>The frogspawn will then transform into a Duckatrice Boss Egg that if hit twice within a second, will summon the duckatrice boss. The egg cannot be moved, meaning you should choose the place to do this wisely since it will also be the place you fight the duckatrice in. The duck you use for the summoning doesn&#x27;t have to be in level 10 and also doesn&#x27;t have to be the duck you&#x27;ll later evolve into a duckatrice. But most importantly, make sure to bring strong pets to the battle and a diverse range of weapons.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Stare Damage</h3>
<p>If you stare at the boss while it&#x27;s angry at you you&#x27;ll get damaged, and the more you look at it the more damage it will usually inflict.</p>
<p>The boss also heals whenever its stare damages you.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Phases</h3>
<p>The duckatrice boss has 3 phases depending on how much health it has left.</p>
<p>In phase 1 it chooses whether to fly or not depending on whether or not it can reach you, in phase 2 it only flies, and in phase 3 it (mostly) only walks. In phases 2 and 3 it also summons hostile duck minions.</p>
