        <h2>Obtaining / Spawning</h2>
        <p>Pygmy dunkleosteuses(or pygmy dunks for short) appear in underground lakes and underwater caves.</p>
<p>Players can also put pygmy dunks in a bucket.</p>
      </section>

      <section id='taming'>
        <h2>Taming</h2>
        <p>They are generally tamed by letting them kill a tamed pizzafish of yours, or(mostly useful in creative mode) by feeding them power bananas.</p>
<p>However, pygmy dunks can be bred and healed with sea pizza, and also ones untamed with the untaming stick can be retamed with sea pizza.</p>
<p>They Tamed pygmy dunks also defend their owner.</p>

<h3>Reinforcing Armor and Elytra</h3>
<p>Players can get pygmy dunk scutes by brushing a tamed pygmy dunk.</p>
<p>Players can reinforce an armor piece by holding pygmy dunk scutes and long tapping/right clicking. Reinforced armor protects you more than regular armor, but the reinforcement will only last for 100 hits before the reinforced armor turns back into regular armor. The items that can be reinforced are the following: Elytra, Turtle Shell(also known as turtle helmet), Duck Hat(not pet hat), and all pieces of Iron Armor. I do not know exactly how much extra protection reinforcement provides, but reinforced iron armor appears to be as good as diamond. Reinforcement durability is 100 hits per scute before it breaks. Each reinforced iron piece restores 12.5% of incoming damage, while other reinforced items restore 25%. Reinforcement can be applied to duck hats, elytra, turtle shells, iron armor, and plushies.</p>

      <section id='breeding'>
        <h2>Breeding</h2>
        <h3>Breeding to get patterns</h3>
<p>Players can get pygmy dunks with patterns by breeding 2 ones of a different color.</p>
<p>Most of the patterns resemble koi fish.</p>
      </section>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Pygmy dunks can level up by killing mobs, when they level up their health and attack damage increase.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p>
<p>Leveling pygmy dunks currently doesn&#x27;t unlock any actual extra functionality, but it may soon, such as better scutes.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>

        <p>However, pygmy dunks can be bred and healed with sea pizza, and also ones untamed with the untaming stick can be retamed with sea pizza.</p>
