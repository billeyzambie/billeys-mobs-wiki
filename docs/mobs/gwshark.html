        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Shark Teeth</h3>
<p>When they attack something, they will drop a few shark teeth, which can be used to craft either the shark tooth sword, which deals a lot of damage for its price, has low durability and has a sweeping edge effect, or used to upgrade a fish sword to a golden fish sword which has more durability, deals more damage and cooks small fish.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Shark Scales</h3>
<p>Players can get shark scales every 10 minutes if you pet(sneak + long tap/right click) a shark, with which Players can craft shark armor which gives you special effects when worn.</p>
<p>The shark helmet gives strength, the shark chestplate gives conduit power when you are generally fully submerged, and wearing the full armor set increases the level of those effects. Shark armor also increases your swim speed.</p>
