        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Gooseberries</h3>
<p>A tamed berry goose can make gooseberries for you by turning certain foods in your hand into gooseberries.</p>
<p>At first it will usually accept apples, and as it levels up it can also turn sweet berries (level 5+), poultry oranges (level 7+) and melons (level 10) into gooseberries. Making gooseberries slightly drains your XP, but also gives the berry goose random buffs and makes it slightly progress through leveling.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Golden Gooseberries</h3>
<p>Golden gooseberries can be crafted by surrounding a gooseberry with 8 gold ingots in a crafting table.</p>
<p>They feed you more (hunger and saturation) than a normal gooseberry and can be used in brewing to upgrade tier II potions of jump boost, swiftness, strength, instant health and regeneration into new tier III potions. Tier III potion effects apply amplifier 2 for 1,200 ticks (60 seconds), with instant health treated as a 1-tick effect.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Gooseberry Thorns</h3>
<p>Both gooseberries and golden gooseberries give the eater a temporary thorny aura.</p>
<p>While this effect is generally active, any mob that hits you in melee will usually take damage in return, and the more gooseberries you have recently eaten, the longer and stronger this aura becomes before it wears off. Berry geese themselves also have built-in thorns: whenever something hits them in melee, the attacker takes damage based on the goose&#x27;s level, making high-level berry geese very punishing to fight up close. Berry goose thorns deal floor(level × 1.5) damage when the goose is hit in melee. For players with the gooseberry thorn aura, the reflected damage is max(1, thorn_time / 600).</p>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Berry geese have ten levels.</p>
<p>They gain XP by fighting and making gooseberries, and whenever they level up their max health and attack damage, speed and reach increase, as does the damage reflected by their thorns.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
