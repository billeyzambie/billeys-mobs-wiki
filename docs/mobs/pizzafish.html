<h3>Sea Pizza</h3>
<p>Players can either kill them to get sea pizza or just shear them to get sea pizza, they will eventually regrow their pieces.</p>
<p>Sea pizza is quite nutritious and has a chance to give you a lot of regeneration for a few seconds, and it can also be used to tame fish from the add-on, and vanilla fish, so that they will not despawn and will not attack eachother. Tamed fish can also be healed and leashed.</p>
