        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Brewing Morph Potions</h3>
<p>To start, you have to make a tiktaalik kill a large or medium slime to get Tiktaalik Slime.</p>
<p>Then brew the tiktaalik slime with a thick potion(thick potions are made by brewing glowstone with water bottles) in a brewing stand. By doing that you&#x27;ll get an Empty Morph Potion, which Players can use to brew morph potions or drink to turn back into a player.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Duck Morph</h3>
<p>The Duck Morph Potion can be made by brewing empty morph potions with a feather.</p>
<p>After drinking it you turn into a duck, meaning you&#x27;ll have 4 hearts of health but will also fall slowly, float automatically and be faster on the surface of water. Additionally, wild ducks will defend you and Players can also quack by sneaking, which also makes wild ducks angry at the mob you&#x27;re looking at.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Hiding your name</h3>
<p>Players can hide your nametag by drinking the same morph potion twice.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>

      </section>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Tiktaaliks can level up by killing mobs, when they level up their health and attack damage increase, and also they drop tiktaalik slime more often.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
