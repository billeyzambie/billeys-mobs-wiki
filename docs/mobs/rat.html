        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Robbing Monsters</h3>
<p>Once tamed, they will attack and steal certain items from monsters, when you attack a mob that&#x27;s holding an item rats can steal.</p>
<p>Rats will usually also have a chance to give the stolen item a random enchantment, and they can only steal the following items: bow, crossbow, iron axe, iron sword, iron shovel, stone sword, gold sword, gold axe and trident.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Cooking</h3>
<p>If you equip one with a pet chef hat(crafted with kiwi feathers and wool) and give it a bowl, you&#x27;ll get a bowl of ratatouille, which gives regeneration, resistance and night vision when eaten.</p>
<p>If you give it a glass bottle instead, you&#x27;ll get a bottle of rat beer, which gives strength when drank but also has a chance to give nausea and/or mining fatigue.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Putting them on your head</h3>
<p>Players can also put them on your head by petting them(sneak + right click/long tap) and then walking into them.</p>
<p>Rats will usually get off your head either when you jump while sneaking or when you hit a mob that&#x27;s holding an item rats can steal. Also, while rats are generally on top of your head, they are immune to any kind of damage.</p>
