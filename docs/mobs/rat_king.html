<h3>Summoning</h3>
<p>To summon a rat king you first have to tame 5 rats and 2 netherrats, all of different variants.</p>
<p>Then, make them sit close to each other and sacrifice them by getting them struck by lightning. The recommended way to get them struck by lightning is generally placing a lightning rod(the thing made out of copper) where those rats that will usually be sacrificed are generally and then using a trident enchanted with channeling, while it&#x27;s raining to cause a lightning. Then those rats will disappear and a rat king will be summoned. Lightning checks up to 5 tamed rats and 2 tamed netherrats within 10 blocks and requires all variants to be different. If any duplicate variants are present, the sacrifice fails and the Rat King will not spawn.</p>

<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Spoiler-free tips</h3>
<p>Do not summon a rat king inside your house, it will usually kill most of your pets.</p>
<p>Also, make sure to bring a strong pet(yutyrannus of any level, or any level 10 pet) into the battle, but a particular action from you will usually still ocassionally be needed. Also try to bring a variety of weapons.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Rat Crown</h3>
<p>The rat crown can be equipped on any pet to make it summon temporary rats in battle.</p>
<p>Additionally the rat crown acts as armor for rats, making them receive only 25% of the damage they would normally receive. Also, the summoned rats can rob mobs of their equipment and randomly enchant it, just like normal rats.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Rat Royal Chef Hat and Rat Potion</h3>
<p>The rat royal chef hat can be equipped on rats and netherrats to make them brew rat potions.</p>
<p>To brew a rat potion, a rat must be given an empty bottle. The rat potion can be thrown to temporalily turn mobs into useless rats, mostly useful against monsters, especially creepers. It doesn&#x27;t work on tamed mobs and mobs with a max health of 100 HP or higher(such as bosses).</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Advanced tips for the Rat King battle</h3>
<p>Hit the chefs while they&#x27;re cooking, to prevent them from making potions.</p>
<p>Some of these potions are quite vicious but others turn your pets into useless rats for 10 seconds. Killing those useless rats will not kill your pet but rather simply make it come back instantly.</p>
