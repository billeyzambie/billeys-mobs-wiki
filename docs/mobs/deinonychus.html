        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Attack Effects</h3>
<p>Before they attack something they  hiss at their target, giving their target slowness and weakness, and beneficial effects(regeneration, resistance, speed and strength) to nearby fellow dinosaurs(including birds from this add-on) and also to nearby players.</p>
<p>This ability has no extra conditions beyond the usage described above.</p>
</section>
<section class='ability-section'>
<h3>Deinonychus Feathers</h3>
<p>Sometimes when they get hurt they will drop a deinonychus feather which can either be used in place of a regular feather to craft slowness tipped arrows or used with a regular arrow in crafting to turn it into a slowness tipped arrow.</p>
<p>Players can also shear them to get those feathers but it has a 10 minute cooldown.</p>
</section>

      </section>

      <section id='leveling'>
        <h2>Leveling</h2>
        <p>Deinonychuses can level up by killing mobs, when they level up not only do their health and attack damage increase but the slowness and weakness they inflict will usually last for longer and be inflicted to a larger radius.</p>
<p>Mobs that level up by killing things progress through leveling more by hitting mobs than by just killing, which means that to level up your mob faster, make it kill mobs with lots of health.</p>
<p>The default level is generally level 1 and the max is level 10.</p><p>Hits grant 0.6 XP and kills grant 1 XP before multipliers.</p><p>Anniversary pet hats double XP, and happiness multiplies XP gains by (1 + effective happiness).</p>
